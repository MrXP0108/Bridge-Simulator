# Bridge-Simulator
One of my engineering mechanics homework is to calculate how materials will react to distributed loadings, so I decided to do something silimar to that. This small C# program visualizes the shear force and bending moment of a bridge against a moving car.

## Shear Force and Bending Moments
When a material, like a beam, supports an object, a loading will apply on it. In order to maintain mechanical and rotational equilibrium, the material would develop internal shear force and bending moment. For example, consider a $3$-meter beam, whose rear end attaches to a wall. If an evenly distributed loading $w=5$ kN/m is applying on it, we can easily tell that the internal shear force on rear end is
$$5\times 3+\text{the weight of beam}$$
kN, and the bending moment on that point is
$$(5\times 3+\text{the weight of beam})\times(3\div 2)$$
kN-m, as long as we consider the whole beam as a system.

And when deriving the developed physical properties of a small segment with length $\Delta x$, we see that
$$\frac{dV}{dx}=w\quad\text{and}\quad\frac{dM}{dx}=V$$
hold, where $w$, $V$, $M$ are loading, shear force and bending moment respectively.

By the two equations above, we are able to draw shear diagram and moment diagram by simply integrating $w$ and $V$.

## The Bridge Model
In our case, a steel "bridge" has two supports at its two ends, so
$$F_l+F_r=\int_{0}^{L}w(x)\text{ }dx$$
and
$$\int_{0}^{L}x\cdot w(x)\text{ }dx=F_r\times L$$
simply hold for such scenario, where $F_l$ and $F_r$ denote the resultant force on the left and right supports.

We also assume that the distributed loading of the car is linear:
$$w(x)=ax+b$$
where $a$ and $b$ are two customized coefficients.

By entering the length and the weight on the two ends of the car, the value of $a$ and $b$ in the previous section are then given.

Once the user enter three valid inputs and hit "Start", the loading on the bridge in the w-x graph will start moving forward, so do the curves in V-x graph and M-x graph. Since the moving of car changes the value of $F_l$ and $F_r$ as well, which are visualized by two red lines at the leftmost and rightmost part of the graph(s), the shape of curves also alters through time.

Observation of one single diagram is also available:
